# avr-glitch-101
the most basic introduction to performing a power glitch attack

### Requirements
* An icestick FPGA (I got mine for $21 plus minimal shipping from [mouser](http://www.mouser.com/new/Lattice-Semiconductor/lattice-icestick-kit/))
* An Arduino Uno target board (see [sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11021)) and [IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)
* Some connecting wires and a transistor
* The [icestorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) open source FPGA dev environment (in a VM is fine)
